# stationary is crucial in modeling
# need calcuate the basic statistics

# Statistics: mean, variance, auto correlation function
# Estimation: estimate from single realization

# Strictly stationary

# white noise is stationary

# random walks are not stationary, because the variance is not constant at each time point, acutally the mean expression is not constant in all cases as well!
# stop thinking random walks as aggragated zero-mean variables, but some variables with mean > 0
