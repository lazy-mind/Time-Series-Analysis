time series is collection of data points

we need graphical view

we use statistical tools to help us to analyse it: correlations is important

1. Stationarity: strong and weak
2. Autocovariance and autocorrelation
3. Random walks
4. Moving average process
5. Simulation

What we actually do:
1. Install R package for your environment
2. install package in R: install.packages('faraway')
3. using package: data(coagulation, package='faraway')
